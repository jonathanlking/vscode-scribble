# Scribble for Visual Studio Code

Syntax colouring and code completion for the [Scribble](http://www.scribble.org) communication protocol language.

Syntax colouring is based on the language [ANTLR grammar](https://github.com/scribble/scribble-java/blob/master/scribble-parser/src/main/antlr3/org/scribble/parser/antlr/Scribble.g).
Future work could add features currently supported in [Eclipse](https://github.com/scribble/scribble-eclipse) (e.g. Java code generation).

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome :tada:

## Known Issues

Syntax colouring is currently very primitive (only highlighting keywords).

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1 (Alpha)

Basic syntax colouring and snippets.
